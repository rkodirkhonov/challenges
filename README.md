# Function Expressions JavaScript
In this exercise, you will be writing some functions and function expressions, to manage the student enrollment records for a workshop.

1. `printRecords(..)` should:
	- take a list of student Ids
	- retrieve each student record by its student Id (hint: array `find(..)`)
	- sort by student name, ascending (hint: array `sort(..)`)
	- print each record to the console, including `name`, `id`, and `"Paid"` or `"Not Paid"` based on their paid status

2. `paidStudentsToEnroll()` should:
	- look through all the student records, checking to see which ones are paid but **not yet enrolled**
	- collect these student Ids
	- return a new array including the previously enrolled student Ids as well as the to-be-enrolled student Ids (hint: spread `...`)

3. `remindUnpaid(..)` should:
	- take a list of student Ids
	- filter this list of student Ids to only those whose records are in unpaid status
	- pass the filtered list to `printRecords(..)` to print the unpaid reminders
  
  
  var studentRecords = [
	{ id: 313, name: "Frank", paid: true, },
	{ id: 410, name: "Suzy", paid: true, },
	{ id: 709, name: "Brian", paid: false, },
	{ id: 105, name: "Henry", paid: false, },
	{ id: 502, name: "Mary", paid: true, },
	{ id: 664, name: "Bob", paid: false, },
	{ id: 250, name: "Peter", paid: true, },
	{ id: 375, name: "Sarah", paid: true, },
	{ id: 867, name: "Greg", paid: false, },
];
var currentEnrollment = [ 410, 105, 664, 375 ];

Final result   > > > 

	Bob (664): Not Paid
	Henry (105): Not Paid
	Sarah (375): Paid
	Suzy (410): Paid
	----
	Bob (664): Not Paid
	Frank (313): Paid
	Henry (105): Not Paid
	Mary (502): Paid
	Peter (250): Paid
	Sarah (375): Paid
	Suzy (410): Paid
	----
	Bob (664): Not Paid
	Henry (105): Not Paid
